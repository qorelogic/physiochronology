[3]Enhancing Our Understanding of Life

   Something that will enhance our understanding of life is greatly
   overdue. Lloyd Brown has made discoveries that will open up for
   discussion and further study a whole new aspect of biology. He is going
   to present these discoveries to people in major cities all over the
   world. This will lead to an entirely new way of studying all existing
   species, which will occupy several thousand scientists for several
   decades. Questions that we haven't been able to answer will be
   answered. Lloyd will not answer all of these questions, but the
   presentation of his work will lead to studies that will answer them.
   Each presentation will be an hour to an hour and a half long, and will
   cover different aspects of his discoveries. Each presentation will be
   followed by a question-and-answer session. Basically, Lloyd will be
   going on tour to share work that is of global interest and that will
   get us past the impasse that our current methods have led us to. The
   tour will last three years and will cover four continents. During the
   tour, Lloyd will also publish his work in PLOS and make videos. The
   videos will be posted on Twitter, on Facebook, and on Blogspot.
   ***
   A tour is necessary to share my findings because of the enormous amount
   of assumptions that have to be dealt with, the sheer volume of
   information to be shared, and because live communication affords the
   opportunity to actually meet people in person. Few people grasp the
   significance of things that don't fall into their preconceived notions
   of what has importance â especially if it is something new. History
   attests to this. Every important discovery is slandered. The person who
   discovers it is branded. Several groups set themselves up in opposition
   to the discovery. There is prolonged (and unnecessary) controversy.
   Meanwhile, a select few individuals see the value in the discovery and
   proceed to either promote and defend it, or, in some cases, to begin
   building on it. This happens at the private level before it happens at
   the public level. Anyone who makes a discovery shares it with people
   who are close to them. Some of them are supportive, some of them
   exhibit a close-minded and unsupportive attitude. Despite the dramas
   that ensue, both on the private level and on the public level, the
   discoveries make themselves known. Their communication rises above and
   beyond the pettiness and the commotion, the slander and the
   controversy.
   I have twelve years of discoveries to share. These discoveries are of
   the kind that to not share them would be unforgivable. The discoveries,
   and their implications, will change our understanding of life. Our
   understanding of life changes whenever we come across new information
   that puts all our existing assumptions into question and opens up the
   possibility to explore things in a new way. Once we begin to explore,
   we start finding answers that our old assumptions prevented us from
   finding. Sharing my discoveries will start this process.
   Physiology is a record. Like rocks are a record of changes in the
   geomagnetic field, the forms of living beings are also a record. The
   evidence can be found in your own face. It can be found in the face and
   body of every living being on the planet. This means that it can be
   found in DNA. DNA is more than just a record of family lines. It is
   more than just formulas of traits that have survived environmental
   pressures. DNA is a living history of the world written in protein.
   Geomagnetic events that last an hour can be read in DNA. Geomagnetic
   events that last a day can be read in DNA. Geomagnetic events that last
   a month can be read in DNA. Geomagnetic events that last a year can be
   read in DNA. Geomagnetic events that last a thousand years can be read
   in DNA. Geomagnetic events that last one hundred thousand years can be
   read in DNA. These events write the same message in the DNA of every
   species. Few genetic mutations are random. The majority of them are
   patterned. The reason we don't understand many aspects of life is
   because we believe everything is hereditary. Then we find things that
   aren't hereditary and don't know what to do. Our only other recourse is
   to say these things are random mutations. The only problem is that
   there is such a high level of occurrence for these things that they
   can't possibly be random. Basically, the way we see life is everything
   is either hereditary or something random, and we can't deal with
   anything that doesn't fit into these two categories. My work offers the
   answer, and once people begin looking at life differently and studying
   it differently they'll find all the answers that are eluding them right
   now. They will discover all the terrestrial events that have an effect
   on DNA. They'll be able to read DNA in a way they haven't been able to
   read it before. The belief that everything is either hereditary or a
   freak occurrence is outdated and harmful. I have found a vast amount of
   evidence that this way of seeing things is far from the truth. Others,
   all over the world, will find even more. All that is necessary is that
   I present my findings and that they are seen and heard by people who
   can grasp their importance. It will be a few people at first, but as I
   give more and more presentations, post more and more videos, and
   publish more and more articles, the number will grow until enough
   people are studying it and doing experiments that its full potential
   will be realized.
   ***
   The first presentation will be an introduction to my work. I will talk
   about myself and about the twelve years of work that I have done. The
   purpose is to help people become more familiar with me as a person and
   to give them some background that will give added dimension to the
   already published material and to any forthcoming material. I will
   share stories of my life so that people can know about me. I will share
   the story of my first discovery, as well as all relevant events that
   have occurred since then. I will also make my case for the necessity of
   others continuing my work, of studying all the different species, of
   studying the brain and other organs. There is an enormous amount of
   work to do and I have to let people know exactly why it is so important
   that the work is started as soon as possible. In order to do this, I
   will emphasize how our current understanding of life is limiting us.
   Our fixed ideas about heredity and random mutations is taking on the
   characteristics of prejudices. Something that was new a hundred and
   fifty ago has become a sort of gospel. The people who venerate it and
   close-mindedly attack anything new would have, at the time it was new,
   close-mindedly attacked it because at that time they would have
   venerated something from the 17^th century or the 16^th century as
   gospel. Whenever ignorance (the belief that you already know
   everything) takes hold in science, something comes along that opens up
   to question everything that everyone thinks they know. The last time
   this happened in biology was a hundred and fifty years ago. Our
   understanding of life is incomplete. A new understanding is on the
   verge of being looked into and studied. One person has already done so.
   It is time for others to do so â not just here, but in every country.
   This will be followed by a question-and-answer session which will last
   between ten to thirty minutes, depending on the questions.
   The second presentation is going to be about the mutations,
   specifically how they relate to ethnicity and gender. None of these
   mutations are specific to any ethnicity or gender. They are the same
   across the board. Whether you are a male or a female, whether you have
   inherited genes from Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South
   America, or Australia â these mutations have the same effect on your
   physiology. I will illustrate this with pictures, pointing out each
   mutation in each picture. After thoroughly going through a few of the
   mutations, I will then proceed to discuss the implications of these
   ethnicity-less and gender-less mutations. People focus too much on
   ethnicity and gender. For some people, it's all they focus on. The fact
   that there are ethnicity-less and gender-less traits is going to change
   people's ethnicity-centered and gender-centered way of seeing things.
   Every one of us have these traits. There is a part of each of us that
   we share with others and that has nothing to do with any of our ethnic
   heritages or whether we are male or female. Some of these traits have
   been mistaken as masculine or feminine. Some of these traits have been
   mistaken for Asian, African, European. This is actually extremely
   important. Not only does knowing these traits explain why we sometimes
   confuse people's ethnicity or gender (for example, I know someone who
   is often asked if he has Chinese heritage although he doesn't), but it
   also offers an explanation of (and will perhaps lead to the discovery
   of exact dates of) the origin of ethnicities. These mutations
   correspond to terrestrial events (changes in the magnetic polarity of
   the earth, for example) and once we discover what events cause what
   mutations (and many of the mutations are things we associate with
   ethnicity â epicanthic folds, for example, or pale skin), we'll be able
   to find out exactly when they came into being. First it will be an
   approximation. As we learn more and more about the patterns of
   terrestrial events and their effects on DNA, the dates will be more and
   more precise. Not only will this help us with the origins of human
   ethnicities, it will also help us in figuring out the origins of all
   the species. Perhaps in our lifetime.
   The third presentation will be on sharing the different genetic
   mutations. How the physiology of two living beings (in this case, human
   beings) is similar when they share different numbers of genetic
   mutations â from how similar their physiology is if they share one
   genetic mutation, how similar their physiology is if they share two
   genetic mutations, all the way to how similar their physiology is if
   they share six genetic mutations â will be illustrated with pictures.
   Monozygotic twins should have all the same genetic mutations, and they
   often do, but sometimes they don't. This is the reason why some
   monozygotic twins aren't identical â they have one or two differing
   mutations. I will explain why this happens. The topic of animals giving
   birth to litters will be discussed. Specifically, why all the pups born
   in a litter do not look exactly the same. Discovering the reason that
   this occurs is one of the reasons that the study of patterned genetic
   mutations must be extended to other species. I will also discuss the
   subject of doppelgangers. Contrary to popular belief, we all have more
   than one doppelganger. Because genetic mutations (not all mutations,
   but the majority of them) are patterned you have doppelgangers from the
   past. Sixty years ago there were people you aren't related to who
   looked exactly like you and in sixty years there will be people you
   aren't related to who will look exactly like you. Three hundred years
   ago there were people you aren't related to who looked exactly like you
   and three hundred years there will be people you aren't related to who
   will look exactly like you. Sometimes these people have five or six of
   the genetic mutations you have, sometimes it's only one or two.
   Mathematically, about fifteen percent of the people on this planet
   share one of the patterned genetic mutations you have with you. This is
   true of each mutation you have (unless one of them is random).
   Mathematically, about fifteen percent of all the people who have ever
   existed, and who will ever exist, share a genetic mutation with you.
   Since it only takes one or two of the same genetic mutations to make
   two people who aren't related look almost exactly alike, mathematically
   the chances are extremely high that several people that exist, that
   have existed, and that will exist, are your doppelgangers. They have
   already found people from the past who are doppelgangers of several
   celebrities. They've also found many living people that are
   doppelgangers of celebrities. This presentation will explain why this
   occurs.
   The fourth presentation will be on the combinations of different
   patterned genetic mutations and their effects on physiology. It will
   begin with pictures of a person with one of the mutations, followed by
   a picture of a person with another mutation, followed by a person with
   both. This is to illustrate how the patterned genetic mutations blend
   with each other. This phenomenon explains why you run into people who
   look like two people you know combined with each other. There are,
   roughly, a thousand and three hundred different combinations. I will
   provide an example of each of these combinations. I will also call for
   someone to begin documenting these one thousand and three hundred
   combinations in each ethnicity â a project whose scope is far beyond
   the abilities of one person. These thousand and three hundred
   combinations of patterned genetic mutations (which all have a range of
   effects on physiology), along with inherited traits (and random
   mutations) account for all the different faces in the world. What has
   prevented people from finding the patterned genetic mutations is their
   perceptual bias. They have focused on ethnicity, on inherited traits,
   and on random mutations. They see people looking alike (who aren't
   related) as some strange, unexplainable thing. Once all the patterned
   genetic mutations are found and their effects on physiology thoroughly
   studied, we will be able to predict what people will look like in
   centuries to come and we will be able to determine how people from the
   past looked. By figuring out which genetic mutations they had, we'll be
   able to reconstruct faces of people who we only have drawings of, or
   verbal descriptions of. We'll also be able to end disputes about
   birthdates. For example, there is a debate abut what year Julius Caesar
   was born. By figuring out what patterned genetic mutations he had, we
   can figure out what year he was born in.
   The fifth presentation will be an update of all new developments and
   discoveries. Once people start looking into these patterned genetic
   mutations, there will be a lot to share. I have already encountered
   evidence that there are two patterned mutations in addition to the ones
   I have already studied. If I have not looked into them and if I haven't
   found anyone who would like to look into them, I will mention them in
   the fifth presentation and ask if anyone would like to look into them,
   either by themselves or in partnership with me. With just what I have
   in my own database, there is enough for a whole team to study and look
   into for a year or more. I will do a fifth presentation when there are
   enough new developments to warrant one. If there is a major discovery,
   it will be the main topic. I will also respond to criticisms. This
   basic format will hold true for every presentation after the fifth
   presentation. Whenever there are several discoveries or developments to
   be shared, whenever there are any major discoveries, there will be a
   presentation to share them.
   ***
   My project and objectives will be evaluated by the public. Everything
   will be available to anyone who is interested in analyzing any part of
   it. All the presentations will have videos that anyone can watch.
   Everyone is welcome to make comments, to lay forth criticisms, to make
   suggestions, to offer help, to participate, to do their own studies.
   This will mostly be done through communication via the internet â
   websites like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.
   ***
   In addition to the presentations, the videos, and social media
   websites, I will also send my main work to PLOS to be reviewed.
   ***
   The goal of this project is to share findings which will enhance our
   understanding of biology and which will lead to further studies by
   individuals all over the world. I expect that only a small percentage
   of people will grasp it at the beginning, but that over the course of
   time, in which there will be presentations on the subject, videos of
   the presentations, more and more information available online, more and
   more people will understand it and that it will find the place it was
   meant to have in the world of science â evolution's complement. It
   doesn't oppose evolution, it complements it. It gives biology another
   leg to stand on. My findings explain much of what our current
   understanding of life fails to. It is imperative that the world knows
   about patterned genetic mutations, but it is also important that it is
   shared in the right way. If not, it will fall on deaf ears. It has to
   be shared with the public. The way to do this is by speaking directly
   to people in the proper setting. Once this happens, and once videos of
   the presentations are made available, interest in these new scientific
   discoveries will grow. More discoveries will result. These discoveries
   will benefit all fields related to biology.

   By going to [4]www.hotelplanner.com/Search/Meeting-Space.cfm, you'll
   see that to rent conference room or theater that seats a hundred people
   costs $600 or more. By going to
   [5]www.plos.org/publications/publication-fees, you'll see that it costs
   $2900 to publish an article in PLOS. Salary for my personal assistant
   is going to be $250 a week. By going to [6]www.extendedstayamerica.com,
   you'll see that average cost for Extended Stay is $75 - $100 a night.
   This is $5250 - $7000 for ten weeks. Part of my personal assistant's
   tasks will be to find a less expensive arrangement. I will require
   $2000 for food (for both my assistant and myself) and travel expenses
   for each presentation.
   ***
   Already collected data will be shared through presentations,
   publication in PLOS, and through social media websites (YouTube,
   Facebook, and Twitter). The main purpose of sharing this data is to
   generate enough interest that people will begin to gather data on their
   own. Data that will be gathered includes: the effects of geomagnetic
   polarity change on DNA (in humans an in other species), the effects of
   the moon's gravitational field (at different times of the year) on DNA
   (in humans and in other species), video recordings of what happens in
   chromosomes at the moment of birth, the pattern of solar radiation's
   effects on DNA (in humans and in other species) at different times of
   the year, what effects the patterned genetic mutations have on the
   brain and nervous system (in humans and in other species), what effects
   the patterned genetic mutations have on the circulatory system (in
   humans and in other species), what effects the patterned genetic
   mutations have on the endocrine system (in humans and in other
   species), what effects the patterned genetic mutations have on the
   digestive system (in humans and in other species), what effects the
   patterned genetic mutations have on the skeletal-muscular system (in
   humans and in other species), what effects the patterned genetic
   mutations have on the reproductive system (in humans and in other
   species), what effects the patterned genetic mutations have on skin (in
   humans and in other species), what effects the patterned genetic
   mutations have on the immune system (in humans and in other species),
   what other periods (durations) of time also have patterned genetic
   mutations (Are there periods that last for a decade? Are there periods
   that last a century? Are there periods that last a millennium? Are
   there periods that last a minute?), and much more.
